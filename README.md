# Customer-Churn-Prediction

**Background** <br/>

Every company wants to increase its revenue and profitability. While they acquire new customers, they also want to make sure that the existing ones stay with them for a long term. It's strategically important to know beforehand whether a set of customers are planning to stop using their services (especially recurring ones like internet, cable, phone etc.). Every company or business creates and tracks customer metrics which are then used to predict their likelihood of churn.

Customer Churn for a company occurs when a customer decides to stop using the services of that company. The churn model output can also be used as a warning indicator that some customers are likely to churn. The key drivers that are making the customer more likely to churn can be alleviated and ensure that the customers are actually retained.
